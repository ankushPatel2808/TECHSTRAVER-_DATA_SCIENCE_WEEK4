# TECHSTRAVER-_DATA_SCIENCE_WEEK4

Project 1: Zomato sales analysis and visualization 
Resources: 
Kaggle: Utilize this platform to find various datasets. 
Technologies: 
o Python: Primary language for data analysis and visualization. 
o Pandas: For data manipulation tasks like cleaning, merging, and aggregating 
data. 
o NumPy: For numerical operations and efficient computation. 
o Matplotlib/Seaborn: For creating a variety of visualizations to help 
understand the data better. 
Steps: 
1. Import Libraries and Load Data 
o Start by importing the necessary Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, 
Matplotlib, and Seaborn. 
o Load your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame to begin the analysis. 
2. Clean and Preprocess Data 
o Handle any missing values in your dataset to avoid errors during analysis. 
o Remove any duplicate entries to ensure the data's integrity. 
o Convert data types if necessary (e.g., converting dates from strings to 
datetime objects). 
o Extract useful information such as month from date columns or city from 
address columns. 
3. Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
o Use descriptive statistics to get an overview of your data. 
o Create visualizations to understand the distributions, patterns, and 
relationships within the data. 
o Identify any correlations or trends that might be significant for your analysis. 
4. Draw Conclusions and Insights 
o Answer the key business questions with insights derived from your EDA. 
o Provide actionable recommendations based on your findings. 
The analysis that we are going to perform shall answer the following questions: 
• Total restaurants and total cuisines all over the world? 
• Which countries have the greatest number of restaurants enrolled in Zomato? 
• Which cities in India have the greatest number of "value for money restaurants? 
• What are the top 10 cuisines that have the highest number of votes in India.? 
• Which countries have restaurants that deliver online? 
• In terms of the number of restaurants, which locality has the most?

The libraries used are :  
• Pandas : For importing the dataset. 
• Scikit-learn : For importing the model, accuracy module, and TfidfVectorizer. 
• Warning : To ignore all the warnings 
• Matplotlib : To plot the visualization. Also used Wordcloud for that. 
• Seaborn : For data visualization. 
Steps: 
Import Libraries 
• Import required libraries (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NLTK, WordCloud). 
Load Dataset 
• Load the Flipkart reviews dataset. 
Check for Null Values 
• Identify and handle null values. 
Data Cleaning 
• Clean reviews using regular expressions, stemming, and removal of stopwords. 
Plot Ratings

Generate WordCloud 
• Create a WordCloud to visualize frequently used words in reviews. 
Sentiment Analysis 
• Add columns for sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) using 
SentimentIntensityAnalyzer. 
• Calculate and print overall sentiment scores. 
Methodology : 
Data Preparation: 
• Load dataset and handle null values. 
Data Cleaning: 
• Clean text data: lowercase conversion, remove unwanted characters, stemming, and 
stopwords removal. 
Data Visualization: 
• Plot rating distribution. 
• Generate WordCloud for frequent words. 
Sentiment Analysis: 
• Calculate sentiment scores for each review. 
• Add sentiment columns to dataset.
